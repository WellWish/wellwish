# WellWish


## About

There's a problem with volunteering, WellWish sets out to solve that problem.


### The problem

Volunteering is hard. We think that everyone wants to pitch-in, but it's often not convenient, or relavent to you. An overseas placement, or heavily organised project is a big commitment. People with specialised skills or tools could make a huge difference, but it's hard to find a way to give back that makes the most of their abilities.


### The solution

WellWish is a todo list for humanity. It relies on two specific types of contributor:


#### The highlighter

Have you ever had a thought that started with "Someone really ought to..."? It
belongs on WellWish. We're looking for self-contained, atomic,
location-specific micro tasks that will make the word a better place. Just
posting your thought, voting on somebody elses, or joining the conversation
does so much.

E.g "Some of the video games at the local children's hospital aren't working.
Somebody who knows about that stuff ought to fix them."


#### The volunteer

Search tasks based on your location, required skills or tools, score etc.  Join
the conversation, and if you can, make the change. Volunteers simply go out and
complete the listed task. Click 'completed' and provide your evidence (usually
a photo). We'll validate your contribution and make sure it is recorded and
celebrated. Volunteers can be individuals or organisations.

  (e.g. a photograph):
  - Wish status is updated to 'claimed resolved'
  - An email is sent to users who upvoted the wish, showing the evidence and
    asking whether or not the wish has been completed
  - An as-yet-undefined algorithm determines if the task has been successfully
    completed:
    - If the wish has been successfully completed:
      - The status is updated to 'confirmed resolved'
      - The user who completed the wish receives a contributer trophy
      - The completed wish's score is added to the users score
      - An email notification is sent to users who liked the wish advising it
        has been completed
    - If the wish hasn't been successfully completed:
      - The status is updated to 'open'
