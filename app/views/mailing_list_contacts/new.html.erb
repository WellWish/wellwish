<h1>WellWish</h1>
<p>A todo list for humanity</p>
<p>There's a problem with volunteering, WellWish sets out to solve that problem.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
  Volunteering is hard. We think that everyone wants to pitch-in, but it's
  often not convenient, or relavent to you. An overseas placement, or heavily
  organised project is a big commitment. People with specialised skills or
  tools could make a huge difference, but it's hard to find a way to give back
  that makes the most of their abilities.
</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>
  WellWish is a todo list for humanity. It relies on two specific types of
  contributor:
</p>
<h3>The highlighter</h3>
<p>
  Have you ever had a thought that started with "Someone really ought to..."? It
  belongs on WellWish. We're looking for self-contained, atomic,
  location-specific micro tasks that will make the word a better place. Just
  posting your thought, voting on somebody elses, or joining the conversation
  does so much.
</p>
<p>
  E.g "Some of the video games at the local children's hospital aren't working.
  Somebody who knows about that stuff ought to fix them."
</p>
<h3>The volunteer</h3>
<p>
  Search tasks based on your location, required skills or tools, score etc.
  Join the conversation, and if you can, make the change. Volunteers simply go
  out and complete the listed task. Click 'completed' and provide your evidence
  (usually a photo). We'll validate your contribution and make sure it is
  recorded and celebrated. Volunteers can be individuals or organisations.
